It seems only fitting that you all, the collective internet communities, get to enjoy some background on the greenstreak platform :D.
The reservation & redemption mechanics were initially envisioned for use by dispensaries as a way to help promote products following
the various legalization measures that swept the west coast. A tidal wave of brands, products, and entities, ensued, and so a competition
based system seemed like a decent way to help spotlight one product over the other. 

Anyway, as what tends to happen over the internet from time to time, not all of those involved were decent folk. 
Some were even flat out running a scam, and so after an unrealistic amount of delays, necessary rework, 
and other such shenanigans a redesign and clearing out of the team’s “dead wood” was deemed prudent.

And so here we are, revamped, recharged, and making great strides forward.
